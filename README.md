# EC440 Collaboration Repository
This repository exists to give students an environment in which they can
collaborate on code that the teaching staff has approved for group efforts.
By default, assume all homework solutions are **not** allowed to be solved
collaboratively. However, the test plans that students implement for those
assignments are allowed to be solved collaboratively.
