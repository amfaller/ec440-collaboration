# EC440 Collaboration Repository
This repository exists to share code both between staff and students of ec440. 
By default, assume all homework solutions are **not** allowed to be solved
collaboratively. However, the test plans that students implement for those
assignments are allowed to be solved collaboratively.


Directories:
* lecture_demos - various snippets of code we have talked through or shown in class. See snippets/lecture_demos/sync for dining philosopher problem with various examples of makefiles and tests
* pthread_tests - place where you can see some test cases for pthread implementation
* tls_tests - place where you can see some test cases for TLS implementation

You can fork your own version of this repo, and then suggest changes to us, by looking at [following](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).  You will definitely get bonus points for tests that get accepted.
