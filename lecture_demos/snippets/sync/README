I used the program from the lecture (from Tannenbaum book.. fix ref) and then modified to use actual code.
makefile derived from Daniel's code examples


To review:
- how compile/link works
- simple makefile
- show prototype, compiler files
- bad prototype
- objdump, show unresolved symbols
- test makefiles
- shellscript to run experiments
- example test programs
- what more sophisticated makefile does
